# fix-getters-utils

This package contains functions which are common to the `fix-getters` tools.

See the [workspace documentation](../README.md) for more details on `fix-getters`.

## Utils

The `utils` functions provide features such as:

- a common `Error` which can be handled in `main`.
- a file system traversal function which complies with the [rules](../rules/).
- a Rust scope tracker which helps figure out the context where a function is
  defined or used.

## Features

The optional feature is enabled by default. Use `default-features = false` if
your use case differs.

- **`log`** â€” Logging via the `log` crate.
